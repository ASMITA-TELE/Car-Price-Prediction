Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the price of a car based on various features such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and engine specifications.
It uses Machine Learning models to analyze the dataset and make accurate predictions.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can estimate car prices using historical car data.
By analyzing the factors affecting car prices, this model can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
